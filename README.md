This repository contains the code i have written for my bachelor thesis work in the University of Trieste.

The whole project was written using python `3.12.6`. 

In order to run the validation and training you need to run first the file `create_h5_database_mol.py`. The path in which the dataset is created is the current folder. The script `valid_train.py` can be executed, executing and validating the models. The code and the plots are available in the notebook `plots.ipynb`
